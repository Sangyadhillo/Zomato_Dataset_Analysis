with each day demand for opening new restaurants is increasing day by day inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of
the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they donâ€™t have time to cook for themselves.
With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location.
